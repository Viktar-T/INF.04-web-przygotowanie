**Goal** : Create comprehensive documentation and prepare the application for deployment. This includes README documentation, deployment configuration, and final project cleanup.

**Constraints** :

* Language: **JavaScript** only.
* Documentation should be clear and comprehensive for students and instructors.
* Deployment should be simple and accessible.
* No custom console panels or overlays.

**Current Project State** :

* ✅ HomePage is fully implemented with filtering and navigation
* ✅ Routing system is working correctly with all routes functional
* ✅ Task data registry is complete and functional
* ✅ Bootstrap integration and enhanced styling is complete
* ✅ Task folders exist with problem.md files and solution folders
* ✅ TaskDescriptionPage is fully implemented with markdown rendering
* ✅ AppPage is fully implemented with dynamic solution loading
* ✅ CodePage is fully implemented with syntax highlighting and copy functionality
* ✅ Markdown rendering functionality is complete with custom parser
* ✅ Dynamic solution loading with React.lazy and Suspense
* ✅ Source code display with syntax highlighting and copy-to-clipboard
* ✅ All components are implemented (FilterBar, TaskCard, Navigation, Badge, MarkdownRenderer, ErrorBoundary)
* ✅ Enhanced styling with professional Bootstrap integration
* ✅ Quality assurance testing completed with comprehensive QA report
* ✅ Asset organization and conventions documented
* ❌ README.md still contains default Vite template content
* ❌ No deployment configuration or production build testing
* ❌ No project cleanup or final optimization

**Actions** :

1. **Documentation** :
   * Replace default Vite README.md with comprehensive project documentation
   * Create project overview with features and capabilities
   * Document setup instructions for development and production
   * Explain folder structure and file organization
   * Document how to add new tasks and solutions
   * Include usage guide and navigation instructions
   * Document the task registry system and data structure
   * Explain asset organization and conventions
   * Include troubleshooting guide and FAQ

2. **Deployment Preparation** :
   * Update HTML title and meta tags for production
   * Configure Vite build settings for optimal production build
   * Test production build locally with `npm run build`
   * Verify all assets are properly bundled and accessible
   * Test production preview with `npm run preview`
   * Document deployment options (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
   * Create deployment scripts if needed

3. **Project Cleanup** :
   * Remove unused App.jsx file (using router-based architecture)
   * Remove unused assets (react.svg, vite.svg if not needed)
   * Clean up any unused dependencies
   * Ensure consistent code formatting across all files
   * Verify all imports and exports are correct
   * Review and optimize console.log statements (keep required ones for exam tasks)
   * Remove any development-only code or comments

4. **Final Testing** :
   * Test production build on local server
   * Verify all routes work in production mode
   * Test responsive design on different screen sizes
   * Verify accessibility compliance
   * Test all tasks and solutions work correctly
   * Verify markdown rendering and image loading
   * Test copy-to-clipboard functionality
   * Verify error handling and edge cases

**Acceptance criteria** :

* README.md provides clear setup and usage instructions for both development and production
* Project builds successfully for production with optimized bundle
* All routes and functionality work correctly in production build
* Documentation is comprehensive and helpful for students and instructors
* No unused files or dependencies remain in the codebase
* HTML title and meta tags are updated for production
* All assets are properly bundled and accessible in production
* Deployment options are documented and tested
* Code is clean, optimized, and production-ready

**Deliverables** :

* Comprehensive README.md with project documentation
* Updated HTML title and meta tags for production
* Optimized Vite build configuration
* Production build testing and verification
* Deployment instructions for multiple platforms
* Clean, production-ready codebase with unused files removed
* Documentation of project structure and conventions
* Troubleshooting guide and FAQ section
